# TSP-Search-Algorithm

This project contains 5 algorithms. They are `Branch and Bound`, `Simulated Annealing`, `2-Opt Exchange`, `Approximate MST` and `Nearest Neighbor`.

`DataParser.java` is used to convert input file into a geo-matrix and write result into output file.

`TSP.java` is the main function of this project which decides which algorithm will be called according to user's input.

`Branch and Bound` algorithm contains 4 `.java` files, which are `BnB.java`, `DummyNode.java`, `MyBranchAndBound.java` and `Node.java`.

`Simulated Annealing` and `2-OPT Exchange` are written in `SimulatedAnnealing.java` and `TwoOptExchange.java` separately.

`Approximate MST` contains a `uf` package which implement union and find algorithm. Its main algorithm is in `TSPMSTApproximation.java`.

`Nearest Neighbor` is written in `TSP.java`.
